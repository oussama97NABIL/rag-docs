Pydantic data models for the RAG backend.

These models describe the shape of the requests and responses accepted by
the REST API. They make it easy to validate incoming data and to
serialize responses back to the client. The models are deliberately
simple: a question from the user and an answer with supporting sources.

    The user must supply a single string field called ``question``.  The
